Ingredients:
 - 2/3 cup masala paste
 - 1 can full fat coconut milk
 - 1 can stewed tomatoes
 - 1 onion, diced
 - 1 cup red lentils
 - oil (I like to use peanut oil)
 - 1 cup (dry) rice
 - minced garlic (optional)
 - veggie broth or water
 - cooked veggies (e.g. spinach or peas, or whatever you have around the house)

Directions:
 1. Start the rice.
 2. Saut√© the onions in some oil.
 3. When they start to turn translucent, add the masala paste. Maybe add a
    little garlic too, depending on your masala paste. Stir constantly for 30
    seconds or so.
 4. Add the coconut milk and stewed tomatoes. Break up the tomatoes using your
    spatula or spoon. Stir until the masala paste is well incorporated.
 5. Add the red lentils. Simmer until the lentils are cooked. Add broth or water
    if the sauce gets too thick. Add veggies when it makes sense, e.g. wait
    until the end if they are still warm, or add them earlier if they're cold
    leftovers.
